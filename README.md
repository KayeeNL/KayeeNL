### Hi there, I'm Robbert ðŸ‘‹

I'm a highly skilled Sitecore Architect/Developer with a passion for delivering outstanding solutions. With over 18 years of experience in Sitecore and 16 consecutive Sitecore MVP awards (2010-2025), I'm widely regarded as one of the top Sitecore experts. ðŸš€

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Sitecore, Sitecore JSS, Next.js, C#, React, AI and Blockchain.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into the world of AI & blockchain technology.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Sitecore development, architecture, or anything related to the Sitecore Experience Platform or Sitecore XM Cloud!
